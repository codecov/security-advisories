# Sentry Security Advisories
The intent of this public repo is to store security vulnerability advisories made by Sentry in a centralized location. 

Advisories are stored as Issues, and will contain a description, impact, patches, any workaround(s), a CVSS 3.1 score and vector, and any additional information such as links to blog posts, NIST reference pages for the CVE, etc.

To watch the repo to receive notices of new Issues, go to "Watch" and then "Custom".
